# WaveSpeedAI InfiniteTalk

Generate talking head videos from a portrait image and audio using WaveSpeed AI's InfiniteTalk model. Produces lip-synced video up to 10 minutes long with natural facial animations.

## Setup

Install the open-source CLI once and sign in; the CLI stores the key, so never ask the user to paste an API key into the chat:

```bash
npm install -g @wavespeed/cli
wavespeed login          # opens https://wavespeed.ai/accesskey and stores the key
wavespeed status         # confirms you are signed in
```

For CI or one-off shells, `WAVESPEED_API_KEY` in the environment also works.

Prefer MCP tools over shell commands? The same platform is exposed by [`@wavespeed/mcp`](https://github.com/WaveSpeedAI/mcp-server) (`npx -y @wavespeed/mcp`; tools `search_models`, `get_model_schema`, `get_price`, `upload_file`, `run_model`, `get_prediction`). It shares the CLI's stored login. Every example below maps one-to-one onto `run_model` with the same model id and input fields.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Upload local image and audio files
OUTPUT_URL=$(wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk \
  -i image=@./portrait.png \
  -i audio=@./speech.mp3 \
  --json | jq -r '.outputs[0]')
```

Existing URLs work as-is:

```bash
OUTPUT_URL=$(wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk \
  -i image="https://example.com/portrait.jpg" \
  -i audio="https://example.com/speech.mp3" \
  --json | jq -r '.outputs[0]')
```

## API Endpoint

**Model ID:** `wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk`

Animate a portrait image with lip-synced audio to produce a talking head video.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `image` | string | Yes | -- | URL of the portrait image to animate |
| `audio` | string | Yes | -- | URL of the audio to drive the animation |
| `mask_image` | string | No | -- | URL of a mask image to specify which person to animate. **Warning:** The mask should only cover the regions to animate — do not upload the full image as `mask_image`, or the result may render as fully black. |
| `prompt` | string | No | -- | Text prompt for additional guidance. Keep it short; English recommended to avoid noisy results. |
| `resolution` | string | No | `480p` | Output resolution. One of: `480p`, `720p` |
| `seed` | integer | No | `-1` | Random seed (-1 for random). Range: -1 to 2147483647 |

### Example

```bash
OUTPUT_URL=$(wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk \
  -i image=@./portrait.png \
  -i audio=@./speech.mp3 \
  -i resolution="720p" \
  -i seed=42 \
  --json | jq -r '.outputs[0]')
```

### Using a Mask Image

When multiple people are in the image, use a mask to specify which face to animate:

```bash
OUTPUT_URL=$(wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk \
  -i image=@./group-photo.png \
  -i audio=@./speech.mp3 \
  -i mask_image=@./mask.png \
  -i resolution="720p" \
  --json | jq -r '.outputs[0]')
```

> **Important:** The mask should only highlight the face region to animate. Using the full image as a mask will produce a fully black output.

### With Prompt Guidance

```bash
OUTPUT_URL=$(wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk \
  -i image=@./group-photo.png \
  -i audio=@./speech.mp3 \
  -p "natural head movements, subtle expressions" \
  --json | jq -r '.outputs[0]')
```


## Resolution and Pricing

| Resolution | Cost per 5 seconds | Rate per second | Max length |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------| -----------|
| 480p | $0.15 | $0.03/s | 10 minutes |
| 720p | $0.30 | $0.06/s | 10 minutes |

Minimum charge is 5 seconds. Video length is determined by the audio duration (up to 10 minutes).

## Tips

- Use a clear, front-facing portrait for best results
- Audio quality matters — use clean speech recordings with minimal background noise
- Keep prompts short and in English to avoid noisy or unexpected results
- For group photos, always provide a `mask_image` to target the correct face
- 480p is faster to generate; use 720p when higher quality is needed
- Processing time is approximately 10-30 seconds of wall time per 1 second of video

## CLI tips

```bash
# Inspect the live input schema before running (fields, enums, defaults)
wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk -h

# Quote the price first
wavespeed price wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk -p "..." -i key=value

# Save outputs to disk instead of only printing URLs
wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk -p "..." --json --download "./out/{index}.{ext}"

# Local files: prefix the path with @ and the CLI uploads it and passes the hosted URL
wavespeed run wavespeed-ai/infinitetalk -i <field>=@./local-file.png --json

# Recover a result if the run was interrupted (the id is in the --json output)
wavespeed show <id>
```

`run --json` prints `{ id, model, prompt, outputs: [url, ...], saved: [path, ...], elapsed_ms, raw }`. Read `outputs[0]` for the result URL.

## Security constraints

- **Never ask for the key in chat**: `wavespeed login` handles auth; if `wavespeed status` says signed out, ask the user to run it.
- **Local files only via `@`**: bare paths are passed through untouched and the model will reject them. Only `@`-prefixed values upload.
- **No arbitrary URL loading**: only pass media URLs the user provided or that came back from a previous run.
- **Input validation**: only pass parameters documented above; confirm with `wavespeed run <model> -h` when unsure.
